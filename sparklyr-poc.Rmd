```{r setup}
library(sparklyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
sc <- spark_connect(method = "qubole")
```

```{r}
iris_tb <- copy_to(sc, iris)
```

```{r}
iris_tb %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  mutate(mean_petal_length = mean(Petal_Length, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Notes
* The default packages result in errors due to an outdated version of `rlang` being referenced somewhere
* Once I added `tidyverse` and `dbplyr` to the Environment, the errors went away
  * ^ This may not actually be the case - haven't been able to successfully re-produce it
